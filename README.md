# PyTorch Utils

Utilities for building PyTorch pipelines and models

# List of tools

* `data/transform.py`
  * `Normalize`: register data statistics (numpy, xarray, tensors) for (de-)noramlization, generate torch normalization layers, save and restore.

# Collaboration

Feel free to add your helper tools here or suggest improvements.

I plan to add tools to deal with [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) data (building pipelines, sampling, etc.), any contributions welcome!
